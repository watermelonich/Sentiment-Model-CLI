the rain outside is so calming.
my favorite song is playing on the radio!
I can't believe I aced that difficult test!
the aroma of coffee fills the air.
I'm so excited for the weekend!
the traffic is horrendous during rush hour!
I love the feeling of sand between my toes at the beach!
my heart races when I see a cute puppy!
I can't stand the taste of spicy food!
the view from the mountaintop is breathtaking!
